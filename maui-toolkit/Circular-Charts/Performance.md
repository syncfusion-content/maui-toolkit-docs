# Performance in .NET MAUI Charts

* If your underlying data object implements INotifyPropertyChanged, you can enable the `ListenPropertyChange` property on the series to make the chart listen to the property changes of your data objects.

* However, enabling the ListenPropertyChange property registers the PropertyChanged event for every object in the data source.

* When dealing with a large number of data points, registering these events can slow down the chart's loading time.

* To optimize performance and avoid unnecessary event registration, the ListenPropertyChange property is set to `false`.
