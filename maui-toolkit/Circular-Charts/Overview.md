# .NET MAUI Circular Chart Overview

The Syncfusion® Toolkit for .NET MAUI Circular Charts ([SfCircularChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui-toolkit/Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit.Charts.SfCircularChart.html)) provides a visually stunning and feature-rich way to display data in high-quality .NET MAUI applications. These charts allow for elegant visualization of data in various circular formats, making them perfect for displaying proportions and comparisons.
