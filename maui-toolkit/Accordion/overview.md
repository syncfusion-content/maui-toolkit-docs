# Overview of .NET MAUI Accordion (SfAccordion)

The .NET MAUI Accordion (SfAccordion) offers a vertically collapsible panel with stacked headers, allowing the expansion or collapse of one or multiple items simultaneously.

## Key features

* **Data binding**: Utilizes the [.NET MAUI BindableLayout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/layouts/bindablelayout) to bind data collections and populate the Accordion.

* **Expand modes**: Supports various expansion modes, allowing the expansion of single or multiple items.

* **Animation**: Allows the expansion and collapse of Accordion items to be animated. Offers customization options, including adjusting the duration of the animations and modifying the easing style.
