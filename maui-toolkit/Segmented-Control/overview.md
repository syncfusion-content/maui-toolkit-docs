# Overview of .NET MAUI Segmented Control (SfSegmentedControl)

The Syncfusion [.NET MAUI Segmented control (SfSegmentedControl)](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-segmented-control) provides options from a linear set of segments containing text, an icon, or both. Each segment is a discrete button, allowing you to select choices in a user-friendly manner.

## Key features 

* Display the text, image, or combination as separate segment buttons.
* Scroll the segment items to accommodate more items without occupying more space.
* Provides four types of selection indicator placement, such as fill, border, top, and bottom border selection.
* Restrict selection to specific segments.
* Customize segment appearances.
