# Chart types in .NET MAUI Spark Charts

The SfSparkChart control supports four different types of series: Line, Column, Area, and Win-loss. The series type can be set by using the `Type` property. The default series type is `Line`.

## Line Spark chart

The line chart is a series of data points connected by a line. A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time, but can also be used to compare two items. The following code shows a simple line series in the spark chart.

## Column Spark chart

The column chart uses vertical bars to show the comparison between the different data.

## Area Spark chart

The area chart is used to show the data as a filled area. It can be used to compare two or more quantities.

## Win-Loss Spark chart

The win-loss chart is similar to a column chart and is used to represent positive and negative values.
