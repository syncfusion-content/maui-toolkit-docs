# .NET MAUI Bottom Sheet (SfBottomSheet) Overview

A `Bottom Sheet` control is a user interface component used in mobile and desktop applications that slides up from the bottom of the screen. It allows users to interact with additional information or actions without navigating away from the main screen.

## Key features

* `State` – Supports various states such as FullExpanded, HalfExpanded, Collapsed, and Hidden.

* `AllowedState` – Allows states like FullExpanded, HalfExpanded, and All.

* `PopupMode` – The Bottom Sheet acts as a dialog page when `IsModal` is set to `true`, thereby blocking interaction with the rest of the app’s UI.
