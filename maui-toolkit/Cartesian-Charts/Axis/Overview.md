# Axis in .NET MAUI Chart

[ChartAxis](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui-toolkit/Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit.Charts.ChartAxis.html) is used to locate data points inside the chart area. Charts typically have two axes that are used to measure and categorize data: a vertical (Y) axis and a horizontal (X) axis.

The vertical (Y) axis always uses a numerical scale. The horizontal (X) axis supports the following types of scales:

* Category
* Numeric
* DateTime
* Logarithmic

## Key features

* Axis supports different types of scales such as Category, Numeric, Logarithmic, and DateTime.
* Allows you to customize the chart axis elements such as grid lines and tick lines, and supports customizing the style of the axis line by defining the [AxisLineStyle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui-toolkit/Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit.Charts.ChartAxis.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Toolkit_Charts_ChartAxis_AxisLineStyle).
* Provides options to customize the origin of the chart axis.
* Offers settings to adjust padding for the axis and axis visible range.
* Multiple axes support enables arranging multiple series inside the same chart area, providing more space for X and Y axes.
